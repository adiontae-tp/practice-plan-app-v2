COPY THIS PROMPT TO START AN AGENT ON MIGRATION
==================================================

You are working on migrating the Practice Plan App from LegacyApp to the new v10 architecture. This is a coordinated multi-agent effort.

REQUIRED READING (in order):
1. practice-plan-app/claude.md - Technical architecture guide
2. MIGRATION-CHECKLIST.md - Track your work here
3. AGENT-PROMPT.md - Complete instructions (read this fully)

YOUR WORKFLOW:d
1. Open MIGRATION-CHECKLIST.md
2. Check the "Active Work" table to avoid conflicts
3. Choose an available page (look for 📋 Placeholder or ⏸️ Not Started status)
4. Claim it by adding a row to the Active Work table with your agent ID
5. Study the legacy implementation in LegacyApp/src/apps/mobile/ or LegacyApp/src/apps/web/
6. Implement the page in practice-plan-app/app/ following the patterns in claude.md
7. Update your status regularly in the Active Work table
8. When done: remove from Active Work, add to Completed Work Log, change status to ✅

KEY RULES:
- Mobile pages (*.tsx): Use components/native/* (React Native components: View, Text, etc.)
- Web pages (*.web.tsx): Use components/web/desktop/* (HTML: div, h1, p, etc.)
- NEVER mix React Native components in .web.tsx files
- Use @/lib/store for state management (Zustand)
- Always create BOTH *.tsx and *.web.tsx if the feature needs different implementations
- Claim work in Active Work table BEFORE starting
- Complete one page fully before moving to the next

RECOMMENDED STARTING POINTS:
Easy: Tags, Profile, Help pages
Medium: Coaches, Files, Announcements, Reports
Complex: Login/Register, Dashboard, Plans, Calendar (need dependencies)

Start by telling me which page you want to work on, and I'll guide you through the implementation!
