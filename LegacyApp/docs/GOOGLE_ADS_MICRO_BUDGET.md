# Google Ads Micro-Budget Strategy - $100/Month
## Practice Plan App - Free to Paid Conversions

**Budget:** $100/month ($3.33/day)
**Goal:** Convert free users to Pro/Team subscriptions
**Focus:** In-season sports coaches
**Last Updated:** December 6, 2025

---

## Reality Check: What $100 Gets You

With $100/month, you're in micro-budget territory. Here's what's realistic:

**Expected Performance:**
- **Clicks:** 60-100 per month (assuming $1-1.50 CPC)
- **Impressions:** 2,000-5,000 per month
- **Sign-ups:** 3-8 per month (assuming 5% conversion rate)
- **Paid Conversions:** 0-2 per month initially (need longer-term tracking)

**To succeed, you must:**
- ✅ Be extremely targeted (long-tail keywords only)
- ✅ Have conversion tracking set up perfectly
- ✅ Optimize weekly (every click counts)
- ✅ Focus on high-intent searches only
- ❌ Don't use Display or YouTube (too expensive for this budget)
- ❌ Don't target broad keywords (you'll waste money)

---

## Campaign Structure

### ONE Campaign Only (To Start)
**Campaign Name:** "Practice Planning - Conversion"
**Type:** Search
**Daily Budget:** $3.33
**Bidding:** Manual CPC (you need control at this budget)
**Networks:** Google Search ONLY (disable Search Partners)

**Why only one campaign?**
With $100/month, splitting budgets dilutes your data. Focus on ONE winning strategy first.

---

## Keywords: Ultra-Targeted Only

### Tier 1: Exact Match (Primary - 80% of budget)
These get you high-intent coaches ready to pay for solutions:

```

[football practice planning software]
[basketball practice planning software]

```

"practice template software"
"coach planning app"
```

### Negative Keywords (CRITICAL - Add Day 1)

-diy
-template (without "software")
-printable
-pdf (unless they're searching for "pdf export software")
-lesson plan
-teacher
-medical
-doctor
-therapy
-music
-piano
-job
-jobs
-hiring

## Conversion Tracking (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### You MUST track these events:

1. **Primary Conversion:** Pro/Team subscription purchase
   ```javascript
   // When user completes payment
   gtag('event', 'conversion', {
     'send_to': 'AW-CONVERSION_ID/CONVERSION_LABEL',
     'value': 29.99, // or 49.99 for Team
     'currency': 'USD',
     'transaction_id': subscriptionId
   });
   ```

2. **Secondary Conversion:** Clicked "Upgrade" button
   ```javascript
   // When user clicks any upgrade CTA
   gtag('event', 'conversion', {
     'send_to': 'AW-CONVERSION_ID/UPGRADE_CLICK_LABEL'
   });
   ```

3. **Micro-conversion:** Viewed pricing page
   ```javascript
   // When user visits /pricing or /upgrade
   gtag('event', 'view_pricing', {
     'send_to': 'AW-CONVERSION_ID/VIEW_PRICING_LABEL'
   });
   ```

### UTM Parameters
Add to all ad URLs:
```
?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=practice-planning&utm_content={ad_id}
```

This lets you track which ads drive conversions in Google Analytics.

---

## When to Pause Everything

**Stop and reassess if:**
- After 100 clicks with 0 conversions → Landing page problem
- Cost per click exceeds $3 → Wrong keywords, too competitive
- CTR below 1% after 30 days → Ad copy not resonating
- Bounce rate > 80% on landing page → Traffic quality issue

**Troubleshooting:**
- High CPC? → Target longer-tail keywords
- Low CTR? → Rewrite ad copy to match search intent
- Clicks but no conversions? → Fix landing page (pricing too high? CTA unclear?)

---

## Advanced: When You Have More Budget

### If you scale to $300/month:
1. Add **Campaign 2:** Brand terms (`[practice plan app]`)
2. Add **Campaign 3:** Retargeting (Google Display Network)
3. Test **broad match** with smart bidding

### If you scale to $500/month:
1. Add **Microsoft Ads** (Bing) - Same strategy, cheaper clicks
2. Add **YouTube remarketing** videos
3. Split campaigns by sport (Football, Basketball, etc.)

### If you scale to $1,000+/month:
1. Add **App install campaigns** (UAC)
2. Add **Performance Max** campaigns
3. Test **Display ads** for brand awareness
4. Hire an agency or Google Ads specialist

## Competitive Analysis

### Your Likely Competitors in Ads:
- **TeamSnap** (team management, not practice-focused)
- **Hudl** (video analysis, expensive)
- **CoachNow** (general coaching, broader)
- **SportsEngine** (league management, different use case)

### Your Advantages (Use in Ad Copy):
- ✅ **Specific to practice planning** (they're general team management)
- ✅ **Free tier available** (most require payment upfront)
- ✅ **Template library included** (saves time vs building from scratch)
- ✅ **No contracts** (they lock you in)
- ✅ **Cross-platform** (mobile + web)

### Your Disadvantages:
- ❌ **Less brand recognition** → Need stronger value prop
- ❌ **Fewer reviews/ratings** → Social proof is critical
- ❌ **Smaller budget** → Can't outbid them on broad terms

**Strategy:** Go ultra-specific on "practice planning" and avoid "team management"

- ❌ Landing page bounce rate > 90%

**Reassess strategy if:**

- ⚠️ Conversion rate < 1% after landing page optimization

---

## Questions to Answer First

Before you spend a dollar, clarify:

1. **What's your current free → paid conversion rate organically?**
   - If 0%, fix your product first before advertising
   - If 1-5%, Google Ads can scale that
   - If >5%, you're ready to scale

2. **What's the lifetime value (LTV) of a Pro customer?**
   - Average months a customer stays × $29.99
   - If 6 months = $180 LTV
   - You can spend up to 1/3 of LTV to acquire ($60 max)

3. **Can you track which users came from Google Ads in your database?**
   - Need UTM tracking in Firebase/Stripe
   - Need to attribute conversions back to specific ads

4. **Do you have testimonials/social proof for landing page?**
   - Get 3-5 coach testimonials before launching
   - "As a high school basketball coach, this app saves me 5 hours a week"

5. **Is your pricing competitive?**
   - Research: TeamSnap, Hudl, CoachNow pricing
   - Make sure $29.99 is justified vs. competitors

6. **Do you have a free trial for Pro/Team?**
   - Huge conversion boost if you offer "Try Pro free for 14 days"
   - Makes the upgrade decision much easier

---

## Realistic Expectations

### Best Case Scenario:
- Month 1: $100 spent → 100 clicks → 5 signups → 1 Pro conversion = **$100 CAC**
- Month 2: $100 spent → 100 clicks → 6 signups → 2 Pro conversions = **$50 CAC**
- Month 3: $100 spent → 120 clicks → 8 signups → 3 Pro conversions = **$33 CAC**

If Pro = $29.99/month and avg customer stays 6 months = $180 LTV
**At $33 CAC, you're profitable** (3-6 month payback period)

### Worst Case Scenario:
- Month 1-3: $300 spent → 250 clicks → 0 conversions = **Need to troubleshoot**

Likely issues:
- Wrong keywords (not high-intent enough)
- Bad landing page (not compelling enough)
- Pricing too high (not competitive)
- Product not ready (free version doesn't show value)

### Most Likely Scenario:
- Month 1: $100 → 0-1 conversions (learning phase)
- Month 2: $100 → 1-2 conversions (optimization working)
- Month 3: $100 → 2-3 conversions (hitting stride)
- Month 4+: Scale budget or maintain at breakeven

---

## Bottom Line

**With $100/month, you must:**
1. ✅ Be incredibly targeted (exact match, long-tail keywords only)
2. ✅ Have perfect conversion tracking
3. ✅ Optimize every single week
4. ✅ Focus on one campaign only
5. ✅ Have a landing page optimized for conversions
6. ✅ Be patient (need 2-3 months of data)

**You cannot:**
1. ❌ Compete on broad terms (too expensive)
2. ❌ Use Display or YouTube (waste of budget)
3. ❌ Set and forget (needs active management)
4. ❌ Expect immediate results (need time to optimize)

**Final Advice:**
- If you're serious about Google Ads, plan to scale to $300-500/month within 3-6 months
- $100/month is good for testing, but hard to scale profitably
- Consider Microsoft Ads (Bing) as well - cheaper CPCs, same strategy
- Track everything - data is your only advantage at this budget
